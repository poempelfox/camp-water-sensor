water-pressure / water-temperature sensor for #cccamp 2019

This is a project for building a water-pressure and -temperature sensor for chaos communication camp 2019.
As water will be in short supply (the camp will use all the water that the
pipe infrastructure there can deliver), it is expected that there will be
clearly visible fluctuations in the water pressure during the day.
We hope to make graphs about that.

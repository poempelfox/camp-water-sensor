This file will document which pin is used for what.

Because documentation for Olimex ESP32-POE-ISO-board is somewhere
between chaotic and nonexistant, here is a brief list of the
internal ethernet configuration that is in use on this board:
* the *Ethernet PHY Device* is a *LAN8720*
* the *Ethernet PHY address* is *0*
* the *Ethernet PHY Clock Mode* is *GPIO17 Output (inverted)*
* the *PHY Power Enable/Disable Pin* is *GPIO12*
* the *SMI MDC Pin* is *GPIO23*
* the *SMI MDIO Pin* is *GPIO18*
